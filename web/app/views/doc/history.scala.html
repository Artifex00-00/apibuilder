  <p>

   This project is based on practical learnings from scaling the Gilt
   technology organization across code, people, teams, and
   practices. At the time we started on this project, Gilt had over
   100 active committers, a distributed micro services architecture
   with over 300 independent applications, and significant revenue and
   traffic.

  <p>

   We were reaching another pivot in our growth that required a new
   approach to handling the complexity of software development in
   order to continue to iterate and grow.

  </p>

  <p>

   One of the core principles that emerged is the notion of Schema
   First development; namely, that if the interface is truly critical,
   it is actually helpful in practice to define your API by hand as a
   first class artifact of software development.

  </p>

  <p>

   From this point, we started to explore what was available on the
   market, hand writing interfaces for a few systems we were actively
   building. We looked at I protobufs, thrift, avro, swagger, apiary
   ad others before identifying our key requirements:

   <ul>

    <li> JSON: HTTP/JSON is everywhere. By focusing on this standard,
    we can ensure that the tooling we provide is available to all web
    developers - seamlessly including native app, web, and backend
    developers</li>

    <li> REST first: Specifically api.json starts with a list of
    resources instead of operations as we want to encourage the
    identification of REST resources as early as possible in the
    development process.</li>

    <li> Simple and terse schema for a web developer: We wanted a web
    developer to be able to learn the schema by looking at a few
    simple examples. We also are writing the JSON by hand and need it
    to be terse and clear.</li>

    <li> No code annotations: we found that too many annotations made
    it difficult to see the code. Especially in a micro-services
    world, we want to keep our applications simple and pure.</li>

    <li> Compatibility with existing tools: We borrowed everything we
    could from other projects and thus where possible we adopted
    standards from <a href="swagger.wordnik.com">swagger</a> and other
    projects.</li>

   </ul>

  </p>
