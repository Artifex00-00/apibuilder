  <p>
    apidoc generates a play routes file to help ensure that a service
    written using the <a href="http://playframework.com/">Play
    Framework</a> actually implements all of the methods defined by
    the API.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within Play, their are a few features we take advantage for type
    safety of routes:
  </p>

  <h2>Enums as First Class in Routes</h2>

  <p>
    enums are represented as first class objects in routes. In
    order to use this feature, you must use the appropriate imports.
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li> Update your build.sbt file to include the bindabables:

    <pre>
      routesImport += "<packageName>.<serviceName>.Bindables._"
    </pre>

  </ol>

}
