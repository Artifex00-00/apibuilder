    <p>The first step is to create an organization which will be a
    container for all of your services. If you are not logged in - you
    will be prompted to first login or register.</p>

    <h3 class="panel-title">Step 2: Create your first service</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>A service in apidoc represents a full REST service. Each
    service is fully described in a single file. By convention, we
    name these files 'api.json' and store them in the root of the
    project that defines the server that implements the service
    (e.g. the root directory of your source repository).</p>

    <p>
      The easiest way to get started is download an example api.json
      file and then edit it -
      this <a href="@lib.Util.ApiDocExampleApiJsonUrl">api.json</a> file
      is the description of the REST API for apidoc itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are ready - Click &quot;@lib.Util.AddServiceText&quot;
      from the upper right corner of your organization's screen to
      upload your api.json file.

    <p>For many users you are now done - apidoc will present beautiful
    documentation for your REST service. If you distribute the URL
    with the version number 'latest' - you will always have a link to
    the most current version of your service.</p>

    <p>When viewing your service, The left hand nav bar will have a
    section titled Clients. Take a look at the Ning Async Http Client
    1.8 and the Ruby client, for example, to see how they look.</p>

    <p>Each client is presented as a standalone single file which
    should make it easy to drop directly into your project or to
    publish an artifact to a server for sharing.</p>
