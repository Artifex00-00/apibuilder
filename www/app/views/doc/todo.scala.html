    <li> Explore <a href='http://raml.org/'>RAML</a> as possible input
         to APIDOC (in addition to or perhaps as a replacement for
         api.json)</li>

    <li> api.json format: models and resources should be both arrays or both maps</li>

    <li> Automate end to tests of generated clients. Currently client
         libraries are tested offline and manually. Need to think through
         how testing will work across mulitple platforms.
    </li>

    <li> Apidoc itself: Add oauth authentication and user management to projects</li>

    <li> Concept of public vs. private services</li>

  </ul>
