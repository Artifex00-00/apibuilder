  apidoc supports the notion of 'attributes' that can be used to
  enhance code generation: 

  <ul>

    <li> Attributes are globally unique and have URL friendly names.</li>

    <li> Attributes have an optional description.</li>

    <li> Attribute values can be set at the organization level, cascading to all of the applications that belong to that organization.</li>

    <li> A code generator can return a list of the attribute names on
    which it depends. apidoc will then send any matching attribute
    values when invoking the code generator.</li>

  </ul>
