  <p>
    apidoc provides support for declaring your own union types
    (sometimes referred to as sum or algebraic types). The basic idea
    is that you can express that a particular variable is one of a
    known set of types.
  </p>

  <p>

    As an example, in an ecommerce system, you might want to accept
    orders from both registered users (people who actually have a
    username and password with your service) and also from guest users
    (e.g. people who have never visited your application before). One
    way to model this is to define two types, Registered User and
    Guest User, a single union type User that can be either a
    Registered User or a Guest User, and then to model your order as
    having a User.
  </p>

  <p>
    Union types, especially when combined with expressive programming
    languages like Scala, can prove to be very useful and pragmatic
    tools for modeling problems like this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the wire, union types in the play 2_x clients are
    represented in one of two ways based on the presence of the discriminator field.
  </p>

  <p><b>With a discriminator</b></p>

  <p>
    Union type is serialized as a Json Object with the discriminator
    field injected. For example, assume the discriminator field is set
    to "type":
  </p>

  <p>
    Example serializations:

    <pre>
    "user": {
      "type": "registered_user",
      "guid":"f30dc64e-1793-4d59-aa47-71f000e06851",
      "email":"registered@@test.apidoc.me"
    }
    </pre>

    <pre>
    "user": {
      "type": "guest_user",
      "guid":"f30dc64e-1793-4d59-aa47-71f000e06851",
      "email":"guest@@test.apidoc.me"
    }
    </pre>

  </p>

  <p><b>With no discriminator</b></p>

  <p>
    Union type is serialized as a Json Object with one element. The
    key is the name of the type and the value is the Json
    serialization of the actual object.
  </p>

  <p>
    Example serializations:

    <pre>
    {
      "registered_user": {
        "guid":"f30dc64e-1793-4d59-aa47-71f000e06851",
        "email":"registered@@test.apidoc.me"
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <pre>
    {
      "guest_user": {
        "guid":"f30dc64e-1793-4d59-aa47-71f000e06851",
        "email":"guest@@test.apidoc.me"
      }
    }
    </pre>

  </p>

    We also maintain an example application that has a simple union
    type and a controller in play to serialize / deserialize data. For
