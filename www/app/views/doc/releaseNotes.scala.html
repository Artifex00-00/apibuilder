<h3>0.4.42</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 404, that
    its type is Unit. This ensures that we can build friently clients
    in scala which can turn a 2xx/404 response into an Option which is
    much nicer to use when building apps with the client.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.41</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 204, that
    its type is Unit. Previously we accepted api specifications that
    incorrectly specified a type.</li>

    <li> Add validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.40</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support for new datatype map. For the initial release,
    both the keys and the values of the map must be String which we
    believe enables most of the necessary use-cases while minimizing
    complexity. Strings will natively serialize / deserialize from JSON
    making the generated clients much simpler to use.

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "tags", "type": "map" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
    This allows the user to pass in key/value pairs using a map.

    </li>

    <li>Introduce support for enums. Enums are specified by appending
    a 'values' element in the definition of the field. For example:

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "source", "type": "string", "values": ["incident", "plan"] }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    There are a few constraints on enums:
    <ul>
        <li>The field type must be string</li>
        <li>The values must be valid names - Names must be alphanumeric and must start with a letter. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Note that in future releases, it is likely we will rename 'values'
    to 'enum' to parallel JSON-Schema.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li> Validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler. Previously we were allowing specification
    of, for examples, dates as path parameters which we do not intend
    to support.
    </li>

  </ul>
