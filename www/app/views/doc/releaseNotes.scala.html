<h3>0.4.50</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Introduce 'body' on operations. For operations that support
    posting data, you can now specify a 'body' for the JSON document
    instead of explicit parameters. The body parameter takes a single
    attribute - type - specifying the name of a model. Example:
    <pre>
  "resources": {
    "message": {
      "operations": [
        {
          "method": "POST",
	  "body": { "type": "message" }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
    </pre>

    Bodies and query parameters are now fully supported in the play
    2.3 client and the ruby client.
    </li>

    <li>Query parameter support for operations. When specifying a
    body, you can also specify additional query parameters for an
    operation. The parameters section of operations is now interpreted
    as being in the body by default, and if a 'body' element is
    provided, the parameters are expected to be sent as query
    parameters. If this works out in practice, we will likely
    formalize parameter location to enable specifying query parameters
    without specifying a location.</li>

    <li>Added date time helper for parsing date time query parameters
    in play framework routes file. Thanks to Gary Coady - see
    https://github.com/gilt/apidoc/pull/62</li>

    <li>Update ruby client to ensure enums are fully supported.</li>

<h3>0.4.47</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validation added to verify that any path parameters refer to
    fields that are required (not possible to specify an optional path
    parameter).</li>

    <li>Path parameters now must be a string, uuid, or number -
    previously we accepted any datatype.</li>

    <li>Responses of type 204 and 304 cannot return a type - must be
    unit - datatypes do not make sense for these response types.</li>

    <li>We no longer accept response codes 404 or 5xx in any json
    specification. We found inconsistencies across different services
    with these types, making it difficult / impossible to create clean
    clients that behaved consistently. A 404 will automatically be
    handled in the play client for all GET requests, returning either
    None or Nil depending on whether the method returns a single
    instance or an array.</li>

    <li>Play 2.3 Client: Few implicits made private / renamed to avoid
    name conflicts when a user imports json implicits for multiple
    services.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug where ruby client was incorrectly dropping path
    after domain.</li>

    <li>Ruby client breaking change: Removed authorize method as
    signature only supported a single user. Preferred method is to
    instantiate the client direclty:
    <pre>
      Client.new(url, :authorization => Xyz::HttpClient::Authorization.basic(username, password=nil))
    </pre></li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.43</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Replace 'values' element with 'enum' to be compliant with JSON
    Schema.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.42</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 404, that
    its type is Unit. This ensures that we can build friently clients
    in scala which can turn a 2xx/404 response into an Option which is
    much nicer to use when building apps with the client.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.41</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 204, that
    its type is Unit. Previously we accepted api specifications that
    incorrectly specified a type.</li>

    <li> Add validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler.</li>

    <li> Major refactoring of the play client. Highlights include:

    <ul>

      <li>Methods that can return a 404 are now handled as returning
      an Option. This means you do not need to catch errors to handle
      404s, instead matching on the response leading to much nicer
      client code.</li>

      <li>Introduced traits for all resource clients and methods to
      obtain an instance of the resource client. This should make it
      simple to mock the clients in tests.</li>

      <li>Nicer internal implementation of a number of helpers
      (e.g. generating query parameters, path parameters, etc.). Helps
      improve readability of the client code.</li>

      <li>Fix bug to fully specify package of DateTime class.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.40</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support for new datatype map. For the initial release,
    both the keys and the values of the map must be String which we
    believe enables most of the necessary use-cases while minimizing
    complexity. Strings will natively serialize / deserialize from JSON
    making the generated clients much simpler to use.

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "tags", "type": "map" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
    This allows the user to pass in key/value pairs using a map.

    </li>

    <li>Introduce support for enums. Enums are specified by appending
    an enum element in the definition of the field. For example:

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "source", "type": "string", "enum": ["incident", "plan"] }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    There are a few constraints on enums:
    <ul>
        <li>The field type must be string</li>
        <li>The enum values must be valid names - Names must be alphanumeric and must
	start with a letter. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters. Main
        reason to restrict character space is to enable code generation tools to produce
	nice enum classes w/ valid symbols for each value.</li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li> Validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler. Previously we were allowing specification
    of, for examples, dates as path parameters which we do not intend
    to support.
    </li>

  </ul>

}
