<h3>0.4.43</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Replace 'values' element with 'enum' to be compliant with JSON
    Schema.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.42</h3>

  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 404, that
    its type is Unit. This ensures that we can build friently clients
    in scala which can turn a 2xx/404 response into an Option which is
    much nicer to use when building apps with the client.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.41</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Validate that if a response explicitly specifies a 204, that
    its type is Unit. Previously we accepted api specifications that
    incorrectly specified a type.</li>

    <li> Add validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler.</li>

    <li> Major refactoring of the play client. Highlights include:

    <ul>

      <li>Methods that can return a 404 are now handled as returning
      an Option. This means you do not need to catch errors to handle
      404s, instead matching on the response leading to much nicer
      client code.</li>

      <li>Introduced traits for all resource clients and methods to
      obtain an instance of the resource client. This should make it
      simple to mock the clients in tests.</li>

      <li>Nicer internal implementation of a number of helpers
      (e.g. generating query parameters, path parameters, etc.). Helps
      improve readability of the client code.</li>

      <li>Fix bug to fully specify package of DateTime class.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>0.4.40</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Introduce support for new datatype map. For the initial release,
    both the keys and the values of the map must be String which we
    believe enables most of the necessary use-cases while minimizing
    complexity. Strings will natively serialize / deserialize from JSON
    making the generated clients much simpler to use.

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "tags", "type": "map" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
    This allows the user to pass in key/value pairs using a map.

    </li>

    <li>Introduce support for enums. Enums are specified by appending
    an enum element in the definition of the field. For example:

    <pre>
    {
      "models": {
	"event": {
          "fields": [
            { "name": "source", "type": "string", "enum": ["incident", "plan"] }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>

    There are a few constraints on enums:
    <ul>
        <li>The field type must be string</li>
        <li>The enum values must be valid names - Names must be alphanumeric and must
	start with a letter. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ characters. Main
        reason to restrict character space is to enable code generation tools to produce
	nice enum classes w/ valid symbols for each value.</li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li> Validation for path parameters - only strings, UUID, and
    number types are now supported in path parameters which keeps
    serialization simpler. Previously we were allowing specification
    of, for examples, dates as path parameters which we do not intend
    to support.
    </li>

  </ul>

}
