   Apidoc provides a simple approach to designing REST APIs for the
   web. The basic concept is to define your API in JSON first -
   starting with the resources themselves and then the operations
   available for those resources.

   The best way to learn about Apidoc is to browse the examples - you
   will be able to see the online documentation available and always
   download the corresponding example api.json files.
