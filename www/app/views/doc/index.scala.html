   Apidoc provides a simple approach to designing REST APIs for the
   web:

   <ol>
     <li> Create a file named api.json and describe your api (See <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson">api.json</a>)</li>
     <li> Upload your file to www.apidoc.me </li>
     <li> Download client libraries to access your service </li>
   </ol>

  </p>

  <p>

   The primary project goals include:

   <ul>

     <li> Make it easier to define clean REST APIs</li>
     <li> Remove the need for runtime dependencies between applications (e.g. shared libraries)</li>
     <li> Generate high quality client libraries to make it easier to consume REST services. Our emphasis is really on creating friendly clients - with a goal of making it hard to distinguish if the client was generated by hand or machine.</li>

   </ul>

  </p>

  <p>

   The best way to learn about Apidoc is to browse
   the <a href="@routes.DocController.examples">examples</a> - you
   will be able to see the online documentation available and always
   download the corresponding example api.json files.
