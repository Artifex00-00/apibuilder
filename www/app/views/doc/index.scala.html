   Apidoc provides a simple approach to designing REST APIs for the
   web. The basic concept is to define your API in JSON first -
   starting with models, resources and operations.

  </p>

  <p>

   The primary project goals include:

   <ul>

     <li> Make it easier to define clean REST APIs</li>
     <li> Remove the need for runtime dependencies between applications (e.g. shared libraries)</li>
     <li> Provide a set of tooling to enable easier consumption of REST services</li>

   </ul>

  </p>

  <p>

   The best way to learn about Apidoc is to browse the examples - you
   will be able to see the online documentation available and always
   download the corresponding example api.json files.
