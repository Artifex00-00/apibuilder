   Apidoc provides a simple approach to designing REST APIs for the
   web. The basic concept is to define your API in JSON first -
   starting with models, resources and operations.

  </p>

  <p>

   The primary project goals include:

   <ul>

     <li> Make it easier to define clean REST APIs</li>
     <li> Remove the need for runtime dependencies between applications (e.g. shared libraries)</li>
     <li> Code generate high quality client libraries to make it easier to consume REST services. Our emphasis is really on creating friendly clients - with a goal of making it hard to distinguish if the client was generated by hand or machine.</li>

   </ul>

  </p>

   The best way to learn about Apidoc is to browse the examples - you
   will be able to see the online documentation available and always
   download the corresponding example api.json files.
