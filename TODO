ruby client generator:
  -- api/app/models/RubyClientGenerator.scala -> moduleName needs to take into account service.namespace

Breaking changes:
  - Change 404s to be explicit

apidoc-generator:
  ==> TODO: union type

api + spec:
  - introduce service_form distinct from service. Replaces JsObject in
    version.service

Generators:
  - Cache the generators

users:
  - add nickname that users can modify, and display that nickname throughout the API

UX:

  - On adding watch, check subscription and offer the user to enable
    the relevant subscriptions if not subscribed

  - On service visibility - if service is public and org is NOT, add
    note that the service will not be visible until the org is made
    public.

Org level setting to enable semver versioning (default on)
  - prevent backwards incompatible changes once at major version 1

Email user when their membership request has been processed

Implement subscriptions.finaAll authorization filter

Add user_form to api.json and remove db.UserDao.UserForm

Implement backwards compatibility layer - each new version of a
service should be automatically validated against the latest version
with the same major version number. Consider if we require semver
versioning or not.

Automate end to tests of generated clients. Currently client libraries
are tested offline and manually. Need to think through how testing
will work across mulitple platforms.
