UX:

  - On adding watch, check subscription and offer the user to enable
    the relevant subscriptions if not subscribed

  - On service visibility - if service is public and org is NOT, add
    note that the service will not be visible until the org is made
    public.

  - prevent backwards incompatible changes once at major version 1
