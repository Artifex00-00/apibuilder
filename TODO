Add Audit to all DAOs

Consider supporting (from swagger):
  - add license, info, documentation. Remove description from top level (replaced with info.description)
  - parameter locations: header, cookie
  - add headers to response object

Think about:
  - replace base_url with urls which would be an array of [ url, description ]
  - add authentication object support from swagger spec

Generators:
  - Cache the generators

UX:
  - On adding watch, check subscription and offer the user to enable
    the relevant subscriptions if not subscribed
  - On service visibility - if service is public and org is NOT, add
    note that the service will not be visible until the org is made
    public.

Consider adding an organization level setting to enable semver
versioning (default on)
  - This would then add validation messages that all incoming version
    numbers were in fact semver

Implement backwards compatibility layer - when a user creates a new
version of a service, if the new version has backwards incompatible
changes AND the major version number was not incremented, prompt the
user to confirm the change. Considerations:
  - should this be an org level setting?
  - should this only apply with semver versions?
  - If using semver, we should probably ignore -xxx versions (e.g. -dev)

Automate end to tests of generated clients. Currently client libraries
are tested offline and manually. Need to think through how testing
will work across mulitple platforms.
